Live on [Heroku](https://ntu-mod.herokuapp.com). May take a while for the dyno to boot up.

Currently hardcoded for 2021/1 in index.js file.

Some module codes that I use:

For 2020/2:

- MH1101
- MH1201
- MH1301

For 2021/1:

- MH2100
- MH2500

When requesting for the module codes, the first one may take a while to respond as the server dyno boots up.
because... why not...
